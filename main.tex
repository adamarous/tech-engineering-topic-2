\subsection*{Tech and sustainability}

\subsubsection*{Sustainable development}

Effectively use resources available today without compromising the future.

\subsubsection*{Sustainable technology}

They minimise the environmental impact of activities through reusing, recycling,
and reducing the use of resources and energy.
They contribute towards SDGs.

\subsubsection*{Technical contributions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Energetic efficency
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sensors can reduce energy consumption.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Renewable energy
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They generate clean, reliable energy.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Environmental control
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sensors allow quality checking, and thus improvements.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Circular economy
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Maximise the reincorporation of materials into the production
        chain.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Sustainable product development
    \begin{itemize}
        \item E.g. nanotech creates more environmental-friednly products.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Tech trends towards the environment}

These are only applicable if policies are implemented to regulate them. They are
also very dependent on the population's awareness.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Reneweable energies
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They reduce greenhouse gases; research is being done into their
        distribution and storage.
    \end{itemize}
    \item IoT
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They optimise the use of resources by means of a more intelligent
        net of control.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Blockchain
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They authenticate immutable registres for processes and products.
    \end{itemize}
    \item AI
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They provide resource optimisation and pattern identification for
        easier decision-making.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Circular economy
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The idea of reincorporation is being implemented through e.g. 3D
        printing.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Sustainable mobility
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Electric vehicles, public transport, and shared mobility reduce
        the environmental impact of transportation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Sustainable materials}

\begin{itemize}
    \item They don't deplete natural resources.
    \item Their emissions are lower.
    \item Their waste is lower.
    \item They can be reused or recycled.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Types of sustainable materials}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Recyclable, they can be given a different use.
    \item Biodegradable, they can be decomposed by natural processes.
    \item Reusable, they can be used again for the same purpose.
    \item Vegetal, they come from renewable sources that spend less energy and
    leave less waste.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Pros of sustainable materials}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Water and air are better preserved, because toxins are released less
    often.
    \item Energy savings are higher.
    \item They preserve the environment because they don't deplete natural
    resources.
    \item They reduce waste and allow for recycling and reuse.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Woods}

They are generated from the leftovers in the sawmill.

\subsubsection*{Types of woods}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Laminated, they are made from thin layers of grain.
    \item Chipboard, they are made from crushed chips.
    \item Fibreboard, they are made from pressed fibres.
    \item Striped board, they are made from glued pieces of the same wood.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Properties of materials}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sensory properties, they are perceived by the senses.
    \item Thermal properties, they are the materials' response to heat.
    \item Magnetic properties, they are the materials' capacity to be attracted
    by a magnet.
    \item Technological properties, they are the materials' response to
    production processes.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Fusibility, they are the materials' capacity to be melted.
        \item Ductility, they are the materials' capacity to be stretched in
        threads.
        \item Malleability, they are the materials' capacity to be shaped into
        thin layers.
        \item Plasticity, they are the materials' capacity to be shaped without
        breaking.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Ecological properties, they are the materials' harmfulness to the
    environment.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Chemical properties}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Chemical stability, the compound's need for an external agent to
    react or the result of the reaction with another compound.
    \item Oxidation, the reaction with oxygen accelerated by heat provides
    protection against corrosion.
    \item Corrosion, oxidation in a humid environment or with aggresive
    substances.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Physical properties}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Density, the mass per unit of volume.
    \item Electrical resistance, the opposition to the passage of electric
    current measured in ohms, resistivity and conductivity; the materials can be
    conductors, semiconductors or insulators.
    \item Optical properties, the materials' response to light; they can be
    transparent, translucent, or opaque.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Mechanical properties}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hardness, the materials' resistance to being scratched or cut.
    \item Tenacity, the materials' resistance to breaking when hit; the lesser
    ones are fragile.
    \item Flexibility, the materials' capacity to be bent without breaking; the
    lesser ones are rigid.
    \item Elasticity, the materials' capacity to return to their original shape
    after being deformed; the lesser ones are plastic.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Tests}

\subsubsection*{Tensile test}

It uses a stress-strain diagram.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tensile force \emph{F} (in N, kgf, or kp).
    \item Elongation \\ $\Delta L = L - L_0$ (in mm) \\ $\epsilon =
    \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}$ (non-dimensional).
    \item Strain \\ $\sigma = \frac{F}{S_0}$ (in Pa, N/mm$^2$, kp/cm$^2$) \\
    $\sigma = E \cdot \epsilon$.
\end{itemize}
